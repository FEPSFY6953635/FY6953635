        This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogenous 
        classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
        to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
        We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
        active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that...

       Energy is a necessity for survival and this demand for energy increases day-by-day, as population increases.
       This matched alongside modern society’s dependency on electricity for digital technology and transport as well as essentials like heating.
       The energy systems currently available rely on materials that waste energy through heating, lowering efficiency and increasing costs.
       However, zero-loss materials called superconductors provide absolutely no resistance when carrying an electrical current and could be the key to solving these energy challenges - 
      electrical systems can operate with fewer losses and higher magnetic field strengths nearly indefinitely.
       Despite, the optimism offered by there are hurdles that must be addressed to establish the use of superconductors in future mainstream global energy systems.

<h3 id="PowerTransmission">Power Transmission: Superconducting Cables for Efficient Grids</h3>
<p>
  <pre>
  
Conventional electricity systems lose significant amounts of energy through the heating of copper and aluminium cables caused by resistance. 
Conventional UK electricity distribution networks lose around 7.2% of all electricity consumed, largely due to resistive heating in copper and aluminium conductors when current flows (UK Power Networks, 2023)
Demand for energy continues to grow, so minimising any energy loss has become increasingly important for increasing the efficiency of power grids.
Cables made of materials that exhibit superconductivity are known as high temperature superconducting cables, and offer a potential solution because they can carry electrical current with zero resistance when maintained below their critical temperature. 
This means that no electrical energy is lost as heat - even when transmitting large amounts of power over long distances. HTS cables can also carry far higher current densities than conventional conductors, allowing more power to be transmitted through a smaller physical footprint.
    This makes them particularly attractive for use in dense urban environments where space for new infrastructure is limited. Use of HTS cables in power systems have been demonstrated before, albeit on smaller scales, in the United States, Korea and Germany.

Superconductive materials require cooling near absolute zero and there are expected difficulties at keeping low temperatures – requiring cryogenic cooling low temp superconductors. 
    Without cooling, the material reverts to being a normal conductor. Cryogenic systems must manage not just cooling, but thermal insulation, heating from the  environment, distribution of coolant, 
    and stable temperature maintenance - especially important for large superconducting devices (generators, motors, transmission cables, or fusion magnets.
    Engineering difficulties mostly cryogenic system design – Creating and insulating systems that can handle liquid helium or liquid nitrogen at extremely low temperatures like 4 Kelvin safely and efficiently. 
    The design of these systems, including insulation, coolant circulation, and heat-load management, is complex and expensive (Radebaugh, 2004).

<h3 id="MotorsGenerators">Motors and Generators: Superconductors for High Power Density</h3>
<p>
  <pre>
Electric motors and generators play a crucial role in nearly every part of the modern energy system, from industrial machinery and transport to wind turbines and household appliances. 
Conventional machines rely on the same materials copper coils and iron cores, both of which introduce electrical and magnetic losses during operation. 
These losses, known as copper losses and core losses also similarly reduce efficiency and generate waste heat, limiting the performance and power density of the machines.
Superconductors offer major advantages because they can carry far higher currents without resistance, enabling much stronger magnetic fields than copper coils of the same size.
This allows superconducting motors to achieve significantly greater torque and power density while remaining compact and lightweight.
In generators, especially those used in offshore wind turbines, superconducting coils could dramatically make the machinery in the turbine’s top section lighter and increase the amount of power that can be generated from a single turbine. 
These improvements could help reduce maintenance requirements and lower the overall cost of renewable energy production.
Despite these benefits, superconducting motors and generators face several engineering and economic challenges.
The need for cryogenic cooling adds complexity to the system, and the materials themselves can be expensive and mechanically delicate.
However, ongoing research by aerospace companies and renewable energy developers suggests that superconducting machines could play a significant role in the future, particularly where high-power density and efficiency are essential.

<h3 id="FusionEnergy">Fusion Energy: Superconductors Enabling Plasma Confinement</h3>
<p>
  <pre>
Fusion energy aims to replicate the processes that power the Sun by fusing light atomic nuclei to release large amounts of energy. 
To achieve this on Earth, extremely high temperatures—over 100 million degrees Celsius—are required, which means the fusion fuel must exist as a plasma. 
Confining this plasma safely requires extremely strong magnetic fields, which are traditionally produced by copper or low-temperature superconducting magnets.
However, these systems consume large amounts of power and place strict limits on the achievable magnetic field strength (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2001).
As a result, they make it difficult for fusion reactors to reach the conditions needed for net energy production.
High-temperature superconductors (HTS) offer a significant breakthrough for fusion technology.
They can generate magnetic fields far stronger than those produced by conventional magnets while operating more efficiently and at higher temperatures. 
Reactors have demonstrated that HTS magnets can create magnetic fields strong enough to confine plasma in a smaller reactor, potentially reducing both the cost and size of future fusion power plants (Sorbom et al., 2015). 
These advancements could accelerate progress towards achieving commercially viable fusion energy.
Nevertheless, major challenges remain. HTS materials are still expensive to produce and operating them in a high-radiation fusion environment requires further testing.
The engineering complexity of maintaining stable plasma confinement also remains a significant obstacle.
Even so, superconductors are widely regarded as one of the most important enabling technologies for the future of fusion energy, and ongoing developments suggest they will play a central role in any successful fusion reactor design.
