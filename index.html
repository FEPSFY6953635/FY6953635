    <p class="ex1">
      <pre>This paper examines the potential of superconductors to transform global energy systems by reducing energy losses, increasing power density, and enabling high magnetic field applications. High-temperature superconducting (HTS) cables can transmit electricity with near-zero resistance, demonstrating power losses roughly ten times lower than conventional HVDC transmission lines. Superconducting motors and generators offer higher torque and power density while reducing size and maintenance requirements, with particular relevance for renewable energy technologies. In fusion energy, HTS magnets provide stronger, more efficient magnetic confinement of plasma, potentially reducing reactor size and cost. Despite these advantages, practical adoption faces significant challenges, including the need for cryogenic cooling, infrastructure compatibility, limited material availability, and safety considerations such as quench events. Economic and political factors also influence large-scale implementation. Overall, superconductors present a promising pathway for more efficient, compact, and high-performance energy systems, provided technical, financial, and regulatory hurdles are addressed.

    <p class="ex1">
      <pre>The demand for energy increases day-by-day, with a growing dependency on electricity in modern society. The energy systems currently available rely on materials that waste energy through heating, lowering efficiency and increasing costs. However, zero-loss materials called superconductors provide no resistance when carrying an electrical current and could be the key to solving energy challenges - electrical systems can operate with fewer losses and higher magnetic field strengths. Despite the optimism, some hurdles must be addressed to establish the use of superconductors in future global energy systems.

<h3 id="PowerTransmission"><b>Power Transmission: Superconducting Cables for Efficient Grids</b></h3>
<p>
  <pre>Conventional electricity systems lose energy through the heating of copper and aluminium cables, losing around 7.2% of all electricity consumed (UK Power Networks, 2023). Demand for energy continues to grow, so minimising any energy loss has become increasingly important for increasing the efficiency of power grids. Cables made of materials that exhibit superconductivity are known as high temperature superconducting (HTS) cables, and offer a potential solution because they carry electrical current with zero resistance when below their critical temperature. This means that no electrical energy is lost as heat - even when transmitting large amounts of power over long distances. HTS cables can also carry far higher current densities than conventional conductors, allowing more power to be transmitted in smaller dimensions. This makes them attractive for use in dense urban environments where space is limited. Use of HTS cables in power systems have been demonstrated before, albeit on smaller scales, in the United States, Korea and Germany.

</table>
As shown, a HTS transmission design loses only 0.18% for a 4 GW / 810 km transmission link — roughly 10 times lower than a HVDC overhead line under the same conditions (Thomas et al., 2016). The HTS cable reduces power losses by 92–97%, which demonstrates it's efficiency over conventional transmission lines.
    
Superconductive materials require cooling near absolute zero necessitating the use of cryogenic cooling systems. Without cooling, the material acts as a normal conductor. Cryogenic systems manage not just cooling, but thermal insulation, heating from the environment, distribution of coolant, and stable temperature maintenance - especially important for large superconducting devices (generators, motors, transmission cables, fusion magnets). Engineering difficulties arise mostly from cryogenic system designs, creating and insulating systems that handle liquid helium or liquid nitrogen at extremely low temperatures like 4 Kelvin safely. The design of these systems, including insulation, coolant circulation, and heat-load management, is complex and expensive (Radebaugh, 2004).

<h3 id="MotorsGenerators"><b>Motors and Generators: Superconductors for High Power Density</b></h3>
<p>
  <pre>Electric motors and generators play a crucial role in the modern energy system, from industrial machinery and transport to wind turbines. Conventional machines rely on copper coils and iron cores, both of which introduce electrical and magnetic losses that reduce efficiency and generate waste heat, limiting the performance and power density of the machines. Superconductors offer major advantages because they can carry higher currents without resistance, enabling stronger magnetic fields than copper coils of the same size. This allows superconducting motors to achieve greater torque and power density while remaining compact. In offshore wind turbine generators superconducting coils could make the machinery in the turbine’s top section lighter and increase the amount of power that can be generated from a single turbine. These improvements could help reduce maintenance requirements and lower the cost of renewable energy production. Despite these benefits, superconducting motors and generators face engineering and economic challenge - the need for cryogenic cooling and the materials themselves can be expensive and delicate.

<h3 id="FusionEnergy"><b>Fusion Energy: Superconductors Enabling Plasma Confinement</b></h3>
<p>
  <pre>Fusion energy aims to replicate the processes that power the Sun by fusing light atomic nuclei to release large amounts of energy. To achieve this on Earth, extremely high temperatures—over 150 million degrees celsius are required, which means the fusion fuel must exist as plasma - which can be thought of as a super-heated mixture of electrons and ions. Confining this plasma safely requires extremely strong magnetic fields, which are traditionally produced by copper or low-temperature superconducting magnets.
However, these systems consume large amounts of power and place limits on the achievable magnetic field strength (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2001). HTS offers a breakthrough for fusion technology, generating magnetic fields stronger than conventional magnets while operating more efficiently at higher temperatures. Reactors have demonstrated that HTS magnets create magnetic fields strong enough to confine plasma in smaller reactors, reducing both the cost and size of future fusion power plants (Sorbom et al., 2015). These advancements could speed-up progress towards achieving commercially viable fusion energy. Nevertheless, HTS materials are expensive to produce, and the difficulty of confining plasma stabily also remains a significant obstacle. Even so, superconductors will play a central role in any successful future fusion reactor design.

 <h3 id="Conclusion and discussion"><b>Conclusion and discussion</b></h3>
    <p>
     <pre>There remain aspects surrounding superconductors which must be addressed, like infrastructure compatibility. Existing energy systems were not designed to incorporate cryogenics, specialised cabling, or insulation required for superconducting components, meaning sections of infrastructure need upgrading before integration. Superconducting materials depend on scarce or geopolitically concentrated resources, creating uncertainty in supply chains and making large-scale use vulnerable to fluctuations in cost and availability. In addition, superconductors introduce safety concerns — particularly the risk of quenches, where sudden losses of superconductivity produces rapid heating, requiring training and safety protocols. These factors make widespread adoption complex despite the benefits offered.
In closing, superconductors offer significant potential to improve power transmission, generators, and fusion energy by reducing resistive losses and enabling much higher magnetic field strengths. However, their use is limited by complex cryogenics, economic limitations and political barriers. If these challenges can be overcome, superconductors could play a key role in future global energy systems.
